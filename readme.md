# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use: `./start.sh`, it'll start both the backend and the frontend.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.


## Debugging
For ease of debugging, its best to run the frontend and backend in separate terminals, to be able to see the logs separated for each end.
* `cd` into each directory `frontend` and `backend` and run the `./start.sh` script
